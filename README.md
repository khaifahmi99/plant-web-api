## Motivation
Whether you're a gardener, enthusiast or even someone new to plants, get to know the flora that are scattered around the world. Lets live a life in harmany among all living things.
The motivation for developing this web application is to allow more people to get to know the plants so that we tend to love and care more about the nature.
